In an analysis this can often be handled by simply dropping rows of a data set with missing values. \n","- **MAR**: When missingness is associated with other variables we call it missing at random. This name is a misnomer. We really mean that *conditioned on some of the variables in the data set, the data are missing completely at random*. To deal with MAR data we generally predict values for the missing data several times (i.e., multiple imputations) to create multiple data sets that capture the statistical structure of the relationships between the variables and then perform an analysis on the data sets. This procedure is called multiple imputation. \n","- **MNAR**: The last category, missing not at random is for the case where data is neither MAR nor MCAR. It is usually caused by deterministic relationships between missingness and other measurements. \n","\n","There is no direct way to check if the data are MCAR, so, we are going to check if the data are MAR, and if they are not, we will assume that the data are missing completely at random. To check if your data are MAR:\n","1) Take each column with missingness and recode it as one if it is missing and zero otherwise. \n","2) Then regress each of the the other variables onto it using a logistic regression.\n","3) A significant p-value indicates an association between the regressor and missingness, meaning your data are MAR. \n","4) If none are significant, then it's plausible that the data are missing completely at random. Because you are testing multiple hypotheses you will likely get some p-values that are small by chance. As a result you may need to adjust your cutoff for significance based on how many regressions you perform. \n","\n","Therefore, as in this case 12 out of 13 regressors have missing values, we should estimate 12 regressions where each feature with missing values is regressed on by the rest of the features, including the price."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"eccf6b1f","metadata":{},"source":["Another way to test this is to check whether the columns with nulls (excluding the number of supermarkets) have an average price different than the observations which don't have nulls (Miguel Conner).
